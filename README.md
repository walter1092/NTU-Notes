# NTU Notes Repository

## About This Project
This repository serves as a collaborative learning resource for NTU students. Github was initially chosen because of my wish to be able to duplicate the repository in event of any fatal problems (along with the fact that it was initially created for the RMS/IMS Stream). I proceeded to consider that notes from elective modules will be invaluable. This repository is a work-in-progress and I do hope that anyone who wishes to help will contribute.

- Changes after approval require fresh reviews

### Content Guidelines
1. File Organization:
   - Place materials in appropriate course folders
   - Follow naming convention above
   - Include source attribution where applicable
   - Please avoid overlapping documents
Ironically this README is mostly generated by AI, so I will leave AI up to individual discretion

2. Quality Standards:
   - Content should be clearly organized

We believe in giving credit where credit is due. Contributors can choose to:

- Have their work credited with their name/handle
- Remain anonymous
- Link their GitHub profile
- Use any other preferred attribution style

### Example for personal work:
   ```bash

### Example for found work:
   ```bash
   git add Tutorial1-Solutions[Yandex(Tyler1)].pdf <--- Leave this blank if you want anonymous
   git commit -m "Contributed by [XCM/@XiaoChaoMeng/<blank>Anonymous Contribution]"
   git push
   ```

### Common Concerns
- "What if I mess up the repository?" Don't worry! Git keeps track of all changes, and we can always revert to a previous version. No change is permanent.
- "I'm not sure if my contribution fits." Reach out to us! We're happy to discuss and guide you through the process.
- "I don't understand Git." That's completely normal! We all started there. Feel free to contact us for step-by-step guidance.
